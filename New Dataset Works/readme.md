# Grain Data Set Configurations

## Overview
This document outlines the different configurations of image and mask datasets used for training machine learning models. Each training set is composed of different proportions of manually segmented, artificially generated, and variously preprocessed images.

## Training Set Descriptions

### Training Set 1
- **Composition**: 100% Manually Segmented
- **Total Images**: 480

### Training Set 2
- **Composition**: 25% Voronoi Tessellation, 75% Manually Segmented
- **Total Images**: 640 (160 Voronoi Tessellation, 480 Manually Segmented)

### Training Set 3
